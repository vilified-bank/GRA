			<h2> Bolognese Pasta </h2>
			<p>Bolognese pasta is a classic comfort dish that balances richness and simplicity in a way that feels both familiar and refined. The sauce is slow-cooked, blending ground meat with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs until everything comes together into a thick, savory mixture. Each bite carries deep, hearty flavors that soak perfectly into the pasta, creating a meal that feels filling without being overwhelming. It’s the kind of dish that works just as well for a quiet dinner at home as it does for a shared meal with friends—reliable, satisfying, and timeless in its appeal.</p>
